On Monday, I joined the Serverless team as the Head of Developer Relations and Experience.

I can't tell you how excited I am about this opportunity to be working directly with you, the Serverless community.

As some of you know, I'm not new to the Serverless space. I was a contributor to the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/) back when it was still called JAWS (and I have the OG t-shirt to prove it). I've been here since the infancy of FaaS—before "serverless" was a buzzword, before the Serverless Framework even entered its alpha release!

In my previous role as Director of Innovation at [Trek10](https://www.trek10.com/blog/category/serverless/) (a Serverless partner!), I worked daily on architecting, building and operating serverless and event-driven architectures. I felt the pain of working on the cutting edge.

But I also saw the tremendous value Serverless delivers. I relished the moments of seeing someone's eyes light up as serverless clicked for them. I built demos that changed how a company would do business in mere days.

I am joining Serverless, Inc. because I believe in the future that we can build. "We" being Serverless, Inc. the company, and serverless the community.

I believe in a future that has us building and delivering modern applications that are more resilient, powerful, and cost effective. I believe in a future that has us operating applications and services, not infrastructure—a future that has radical focus on business value delivery.

My day-to-day hustle will be making sure developers are served by the Serverless ecosystem. That means making sure we are innovating and accommodating in the name of progress. We at Serverless, Inc need to continue to be good stewards of the serverless and serviceful future.

The future is always just over the horizon, but there is no other community, or company, I would rather be chasing it with. It's going to be a great 2019 and beyond.
